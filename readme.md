This is very much a work in progress.

The idea is to be able to have a record in hand, scan it's ISBN number and get a result from the Discogs API.

From there i want to have an option to be able to listen into the songs. Either through the samples provided by discogs users or I'll add spotify integration or something. I'll deal with that later.
